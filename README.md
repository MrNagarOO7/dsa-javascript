# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript
This repository contains a collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrNagarOO7/dsa-javascript.git
```

You can then run the examples or test cases for each data structure and algorithm individually.

## Data Structures

This section provides an overview of the data structures implemented in this repository. Each data structure includes a brief description and links to its source code.

**1. Linked List :-**
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence.

**2. Stack :-** 
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.

**3. Queue :-**
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.

**4. Graph :-**
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent relationships between objects.

**5. Tree :-**
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It is commonly used for representing hierarchical relationships.

**6. Map :-**
A map is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. It provides efficient lookup and storage of data.

## Algorithms
This section provides an overview of the algorithms implemented in this repository. Each algorithm includes a brief description and links to its source code.

**1. Binary Search :-**
Binary search is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

**2. Insertion Sort :-**
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

**3. Selection Sort :-**
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from an unsorted portion of the array and puts it in its correct place.
